        <h1>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Summerized</h1>

        The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy begins simply with the destruction of the earth, and only one person survives. This person in question is Arthur Dent, who was saved by his friend, Ford Prefect, who happened to be an Alien stranded on Earth for the past 15 years. Ford was able to save him by hitchhiking onto the Vogon alien spaceship, the one that destroyed earth.
	The next part of the book can be summarized into, they get caught on the ship, then they get thrown out of the ship into space. According to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a sort of guide to the hitchhikers of the universe, you can survive up to 30 seconds in space if you hold your breath well enough. Within that time frame the chance of another ship picking our characters up is 2 to the power of 276,709 against one. Not good odds but thankfully our protagonists are picked up.
	After Ford and Arthur get rescued, they find themselves on the Ship of Infinite Probability, a ship that was just recently stolen by one Zaphod Beeblebrox, recently the former president of the universe, for about 5 minutes. The second most notable thing about the ship is that it can do anything in the universe as long as you know the probability of it happening. Thankfully, Ford knows Zaphod as they grew up together, and so does Arthus as they met at a party. Along with Zaphod Trillian is there, she is Zaphods assistant coming from earth herself. Arthur is acquainted with her as well after trying, and failing, to pick her up at a party.
	After Aurthur tries, and fails, again to make some tea, the crew arrive at the legendary Magrathea, a planet now thought to be a fairy tail by most. One of Magrathea’s most notable achievements is that their economy is centered around manufacturing planets for the universe's richest customers. Magrathea had recently awoken from their sleep of around 5million years waiting for people to become rich enough to afford their services. They needed to remake the earth.
Soon we find out that Earth is actually a supercomputer commissioned to be build by mice, yes those mice are the ones that tricked us into thinking that they were incompitent little creatures that we used for experiments. When in reality it was them doing the experiments on us, they needed another earth build as the Vogons destroyed earth just five minutes before the calculations were about to be completed. The 11 million years worth of calculations are to answer the question of what is the question of the answer of life, the universe, and everything. Which is famously the underwhelming answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42.
	Then after a quick incident involving some mice trying to buy Aurther’s brain, and some police officers that were quite unhappy with their current occupation of shooting people. Zaphod suggests that they stop to rest at The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, which also happens to be the title of the next book
